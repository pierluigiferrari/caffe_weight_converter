    '''
    Converts Caffe weights from the `.caffemodel` format to an HDF5 format that is
    compatible with Keras 2.x with TensorFlow backend. The Theano and CNTK backends
    are currently not supported.

    Note that this converter converts the weights only, not the model definition.

    The most painfree way to use this weight converter is to leave the
    `include_layers_without_weights` option deactivated and load the weights into
    an appropriate Keras model by setting `by_name = True` in the `Model.load_weights()`
    method.

    This converter can handle all layer types, but it is not guaranteed to perform
    the conversion correctly for unknown layer types. What this means concretely
    is that the converter can always extract the weights from a Caffe model and
    put them into the Keras-compatible HDF5 format regardless of the layer type,
    but some layer types may need processing on top of that that the converter
    cannot perform for layers it doesn't know. Two potential issues come to mind
    for unsupported layer types:
    1) For layers that have multiple weight tensors, the converter will save
       the weight tensors in the order they have in the Caffe model. If this happens
       not to be the same order in which Keras saves the weights for that same
       layer type, then we obviously have a problem. For supported layer types
       it is ensured that the order is correct, but for a given unknown layer
       type this may or may not be the case.
    2) If the weights of a layer type need to be processed in a certain way,
       the converter is not going to know about this for unknown layer types.
       For example, the axes of the kernels of convolutional layers need to be
       transposed between Caffe and Keras with TensorFlow backend. Similar processing
       might be necessary for the weights of other (unknown) layer types to work
       correctly, so be aware of that.

    Of course any layer types that do not have trainable weights (such as Reshape,
    ReLU, Split, Concat, Permute, Flatten, Pooling etc.) won't cause any trouble
    because the converter does not care about them. The possible issues described
    above might occur only with unknown layer types that do have trainable weights.

    The currently supported (i.e. known) Caffe layer types that do have trainable
    weights are:
    - BatchNorm (i.e. BatchNorm layer followed by subsequent Scale layer)
    - Convolution
    - Deconvolution
    - InnerProduct

    If your model contains batch normalization layers, make sure that the names of
    the batch normalization layers in the Keras model are the same as the names of the
    corresponding 'BatchNorm' layers in the Caffe model, not the 'Scale' layers.

    Arguments:
        output_filename (str): The filename (full path, but excluding the file extension)
            under which to save the HDF5 file with the converted weights.
        prototxt_filename (str): The filename (full path including file extension)
            of the `.prototxt` file that defines the Caffe model.
        caffemodel_filename (str): The filename (full path including file extension)
            of the `.caffemodel` file that contains the weights for the Caffe model.
        include_layers_without_weights (bool, optional): If `False`, layers without
            weights (e.g. Input, Reshape, or ReLU layers) will be skipped by the
            converter. This means that the HDF5 output file will only contain those
            layers of a model that have any weights. This is the recommended usage
            of this converter, but if you really must include all layers
            in the output file, then set this option to `True`.
            Note: If `False`, then you should load the weights into the Keras model
            `by_name = True`, since not all layers are present in the HDF5 file.
        include_unknown_layer_types (bool, optional): If `True`, weights from unknown layer
            types will be included, even though it is not guaranteed that they will be
            converted correctly. It is recommended that you keep this option
            activated, see if the converted weights work correctly, and only deactivate
            this option in case they don't.
        keras_backend (str, optional): For which Keras backend to convert the weights.
            Currently only the TensorFlow backend is supported, but you can simply
            follow the procedure [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/wiki/Converting-convolution-kernels-from-Theano-to-TensorFlow-and-vice-versa)
            to convert the resulting TensorFlow backend weights to Theano backend
            weights.
        verbose (bool, optional): If `True`, prints out the conversion status for
            every layer as well as some stats when the conversion is complete.

    Returns:
        None.

    '''
    Extracts the weights from a Caffe model into a simple structure of
    Python lists, dictionaries and Numpy arrays.

    Arguments:
        prototxt_filename (str): The full path to the `.prototxt` file that defines
            the Caffe model.
        caffemodel_filename (str): The full path to the `.caffemodel` file that
            contains the weights for this Caffe model.
        out_path (str, optional): The filename (full path, but excluding the file extension)
            under which to save a pickled file with the extracted weights. If `None`,
            then the extracted weights will not be saved to disk.
        verbose (bool, optional): If `True`, prints out the processing status for
            every layer.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the data for one layer of the
        model. The data contained in each dictionary can be accessed by the following keys:

            'name':    The name of the layer.
            'type':    The type of the layer, e.g. 'Convolution'.
            'weights': The weights of the layer as a list of Numpy arrays.
            'bottoms': The names and shapes of all inputs into the layer.
            'tops':    The names and shapes of all outputs from the layer.

        In case a layer has no weights, that layer's weights list will be empty.
